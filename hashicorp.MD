ImportingInstances can be imported by the id. For example,
terraform import huaweicloudstack_compute_instance_ v2.my_instance b11b407c-e604-4e8d-8bc4-92398320b84
7
Note that the imported state may not be identical t o your resource definition, which could be because of a different
network interface attachment order, missing ephemer al disk configuration, or some other reason. It is generally
recommended running terraform plan  after importing an instance. You can then decide i f changes should be
applied to the instance, or the resource definition  should be updated to align with the instance.
Notes
Multiple Ephemeral Disks
It's possible to specify multiple block_device  entries to create an instance with multiple epheme ral (local) disks. In
order to create multiple ephemeral disks, the sum o f the total amount of ephemeral space must be less than or
equal to what the chosen flavor supports.
The following example shows how to create an instan ce with multiple ephemeral disks:
resource "huaweicloudstack_compute_instance_v2" "fo o" {
  name            = "terraform-test"
  security_groups = ["default"]
  block_device {
    boot_index            = 0
    delete_on_termination = true
    destination_type      = "local"
    source_type           = "image"
    uuid                  = "<image uuid>"
  }
  block_device {
    boot_index            = -1
    delete_on_termination = true
    destination_type      = "local"
    source_type           = "blank"
    volume_size           = 1
  }
  block_device {
    boot_index            = -1
    delete_on_termination = true
    destination_type      = "local"
    source_type           = "blank"
    volume_size           = 1
  }
}Instances and Ports
Neutron Ports are a great feature and provide a lot  of functionality. However, there are some notes to  be aware of
when mixing Instances and Ports:
When attaching an Instance to one or more networks using Ports, place the security groups on the Port and
not the Instance. If you place the security groups on the Instance, the security groups will not be ap plied upon
creation, but they will be applied upon a refresh. This is a known HuaweiCloud bug.
Network IP information is not available within an i nstance for networks that are attached with Ports. This is
mostly due to the flexibility Neutron Ports provide  when it comes to IP addresses. For example, a Neut ron Port
can have multiple Fixed IP addresses associated wit h it. It's not possible to know which single IP add ress the
user would want returned to the Instance's state in formation. Therefore, in order for a Provisioner to  connect to
an Instance via it's network Port, customize the connection  information:
resource "huaweicloudstack_networking_port_v2" "por t_1" {
  name           = "port_1"
  admin_state_up = "true"
  network_id = "0a1d0a27-cffa-4de3-92c5-9d3fd3f2e74d"

  name        = "secgroup_1"
  description = "My neutron security group"
}
Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
region  - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 networking client. A networking client is needed to
create a port. If omitted, the region  argument of the provider is used. Changing this cr eates a new security
group.
name  - (Required) A unique name for the security group.
description  - (Optional) A unique name for the security group.
tenant_id  - (Optional) The owner of the security group. Requ ired if admin wants to create a port for another
tenant. Changing this creates a new security group.
delete_default_rules  - (Optional) Whether or not to delete the default egress security rules. This is false
by default. See the below note for more information .
Attributes Reference
The following attributes are exported:
region  - See Argument Reference above.
name  - See Argument Reference above.
description  - See Argument Reference above.
tenant_id  - See Argument Reference above.Default Security Group Rules
In most cases, HuaweiCloudStack will create some eg ress security group rules for each new security gro up. These
security group rules will not be managed by Terrafo rm, so if you prefer to have all aspects of your infrastructure
managed by Terraform, set delete_default_rules  to true  and then create separate security group rules such  as
the following:
resource "huaweicloudstack_networking_secgroup_rule _v2" "secgroup_rule_v4" {
  direction         = "egress"
  ethertype         = "IPv4"
  security_group_id = "${huaweicloudstack_networking_secgroup_v2.secgrou p.id}"
}
resource "huaweicloudstack_networking_secgroup_rule _v2" "secgroup_rule_v6" {
  direction         = "egress"
  ethertype         = "IPv6"
  security_group_id = "${huaweicloudstack_networking_secgroup_v2.secgrou p.id}"
}
Please note that this behavior may differ depending  on the configuration of the HuaweiCloudStack. The above
illustrates the current default Neutron behavior. S ome HuaweiCloudStack might provide additional rules  and some
might not provide any rules at all (in which case t he delete_default_rules  setting is moot).

The Docker provider is used to interact with Docker  containers and images. It uses the Docker API to m anage the
lifecycle of Docker containers. Because the Docker provider uses the Docker API, it is immediately com patible not
only with single server Docker but Swarm and any ad ditional Docker-compatible API hosts.
Use the navigation to the left to read about the av ailable resources.
Example Usage
provider "docker" {
  host = "tcp://127.0.0.1:2376/"
}
resource "docker_container" "foo" {
  image = "${docker_image.ubuntu.latest}"
  name  = "foo"
}
resource "docker_image" "ubuntu" {
  name = "ubuntu:latest"
}
Note  You can also use the ssh protocol to connect to the docker host on a remote  machine. The configuration
would look as follows:
provider "docker" {
  host = "ssh://user@remote-host:22"
}
Registry Credentials
Registry credentials can be provided on a per-regis try basis with the registry_auth  field, passing either a config
file or the username/password directly.
Note  The location of the config file is on the machine terraform runs on, nevertheless if the specified do cker
host is on another machine.
provider "docker" {
  host = "tcp://localhost:2376"
  registry_auth {
    address = "registry.hub.docker.com"
    config_file = "${pathexpand(" ~/.docker/config. json ")}"
  }
  registry_auth {
    address = "registry.my.company.com"
    config_file_content = "${var.plain_content_of_config_file}"
  }
  registry_auth {
    address = "quay.io:8181"
    username = "someuser"
    password = "somepass"
  }
}
data "docker_registry_image" "quay" {
  name = "myorg/privateimage"
}
data "docker_registry_image" "quay" {
  name = "quay.io:8181/myorg/privateimage"
}
Note  When passing in a config file either the correspon ding auth  string of the repository is read or the os
specific credential helpers (see here (https://gith ub.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers#available-
programs)) are used to retrieve the authentication credentials.
You can still use the enviroment variables DOCKER_REGISTRY_USER  and DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASS .
An example content of the file ~/.docker/config.json  on OSX may look like follows:
{
    "auths" : {
        "repo.mycompany:8181" : {
            "auth" : "dXNlcjpwYXNz="
        },
        "otherrepo.other-company:8181" : {
        }
    },
  "credsStore"  : "osxkeychain"
}
Certiﬁcate informationSpecify certificate information either with a direc tory or directly with the content of the files for connecting to the
Docker host via TLS.
provider "docker" {
  host    = "tcp://your-host-ip:2376/"
  
  cert_path = "${pathexpand(" ~/.docker")}"
  # -> or the following
  ca_material = "${file(pathexpand("~/. docker/ ca.pem"))}" 
  cert_material = "${file(pathexpand(" ~/.docker/cert. pem"))}"
  key_material = "${file(pathexpand(" ~/.docker/key. pem"))}"
}
Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
host  - (Required) This is the address to the Docker hos t. If this is blank, the DOCKER_HOST  environment
variable will also be read.
cert_path  - (Optional) Path to a directory with certificate information for connecting to the Docker host via
TLS. It is expected that the 3 files {ca, cert, key}.pem  are present in the path. If the path is blank, the
DOCKER_CERT_PATH  will also be checked.
ca_material , cert_material , key_material , - (Optional) Content of ca.pem , cert.pem , and key.pem  files
for TLS authentication. Cannot be used together wit h cert_path . If ca_material  is omitted the client does
not check the servers certificate chain and host na me.
registry_auth  - (Optional) A block specifying the credentials fo r a target v2 Docker registry.
address  - (Required) The address of the registry.
username  - (Optional) The username to use for authenticatin g to the registry. Cannot be used with the
config_file  option. If this is blank, the DOCKER_REGISTRY_USER  will also be checked.
password  - (Optional) The password to use for authenticatin g to the registry. Cannot be used with the
config_file  option. If this is blank, the DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASS  will also be checked.
config_file  - (Optional) The path to a config file containing credentials for authenticating to the
registry. Cannot be used with the username /password  or config_file_content  options. If this is blank,
the DOCKER_CONFIG  will also be checked.
config_file_content  - (Optional) The content of a config file as strin g containing credentials for
authenticating to the registry. Cannot be used with  the username /password  or config_file  options.
NOTE on Certificates and docker-machine : As per Docker Remote API documentation
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docke r_remote_api/), in any docker-machine environment,
the Docker daemon uses an encrypted TCP socket (TLS ) and requires cert_path  for a successful connection.
As an alternative, if using docker-machine , run eval $(docker-machine env <machine-name>)  prior to running
Terraform, and the host and certificate path will b e extracted from the environment.(https://www.hashicorp.com)

  name = "ubuntu:precise"
}
resource "docker_image" "ubuntu" {

}
Advanced
Dynamically set conﬁg with a template
In this example you can use the ${var.foo_port}  variable to dynamically set the ${port}  variable in the
foo.configs.json.tpl  template and create the data of the foo_config  with the help of the base64encode
interpolation function.
File foo.config.json.tpl
{
  "server" : {
    "public_port" : ${port}
  }
}
File main.tf
data "template_file" "foo_config_tpl" {
  template = "${file("foo. config .json .tpl")}"
  vars {
    port = "${var.foo_port}"
  }
}
resource "docker_config" "foo_config" {
  name = "foo_config"
  data = "${base64encode(data.template_file.foo_config_tpl. rendered)}"
}
Update conﬁg with no downtime
To update a config , Terraform will destroy the existing resource and create a replacement. To effectively use a
docker_config  resource with a docker_service  resource, it's recommended to specify create_before_destroy  in
a lifecycle  block. Provide a uniqie name  attribute, for example with one of the interpolati on functions uuid  or
timestamp  as shown in the example below. The reason is moby- 35803
(https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35803).
resource "docker_config" "service_config" {
  name = "${var.service_name}-config-${replace(timestamp(), ":", " .")}"
  data = "${base64encode(data.template_file.service_config_ tpl.rendered)}"
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes        = ["name"]
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
resource "docker_service" "service" {
  
  configs = [
    {
      config_id   = "${docker_config.service_config.id}"

To update a secret , Terraform will destroy the existing resource and create a replacement. To effectively use a
docker_secret  resource with a docker_service  resource, it's recommended to specify create_before_destroy  in
a lifecycle  block. Provide a unique name  attribute, for example with one of the interpolati on functions uuid  or
timestamp  as shown in the example below. The reason is moby- 35803
(https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35803).
resource "docker_secret" "service_secret" {
  name = "${var.service_name}-secret-${replace(timestamp(), ":", " .")}"
  data = "${base64encode(data.template_file.service_secret_ tpl.rendered)}"
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes        = ["name"]
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
resource "docker_service" "service" {
  
  secrets = [
    {
      secret_id   = "${docker_secret.service_secret.id}"
      secret_name = "${docker_secret.service_secret.name}"
      file_name   = "/root/configs/configs.json"
    },
  ]
}
Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
name  - (Required, string) The name of the Docker secret .

Attributes Reference
The following attributes are exported in addition t o the above configuration:
id (string)
Import
Docker secret cannot be imported as the secret data , once set, is never exposed again.(https://www.hashicorp.com)
docker_service
This resource manages the lifecycle of a Docker ser vice. By default, the creation, update and delete o f services are
detached.
With the Converge Config the behavior of the docker cli  is imitated to guarantee that for example, all tas ks of a
service are running or successfully updated or to i nform terraform  that a service could not be updated and was
successfully rolled back.
Example Usage
The following examples show the basic and advanced usage of the Docker Service resource assuming the h ost
machine is already part of a Swarm.
Basic
The following configuration starts a Docker Service  with - the given image, - 1 replica - exposes the port 8080  in
vip mode to the host machine - moreover, uses the container  runtime
resource "docker_service" "foo" {
  name = "foo-service"
  task_spec {
    container_spec {
      image = "repo.mycompany.com:8080/foo-service:v1"
    }
  }
  endpoint_spec {
    ports {
      target_port = "8080"
    }
  }
}
The following command is the equivalent:
$ docker service create -d -p 8080 --name foo-servi ce repo.mycompany.com:8080/foo-service:v1
AdvancedThe following configuration shows the full capabili ties of a Docker Service. Currently, the Docker API  1.32
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.32) is imple mented.

monitor_id  - (Optional) Reference to which monitor this downt ime is applied. When scheduling downtime for
a given monitor, datadog changes silenced  property of the monitor to match the end POSIX timestamp.
Note:  this will effectively change the silenced  attribute of the referenced monitor. If that monit or is also
tracked by Terraform and you don't want it to be un muted on the next terraform apply , see details
(/docs/providers/datadog/r/monitor.html#silencing-b y-hand-and-by-downtimes) in the monitor resource
documentation. This option also conflicts with monitor_tags  use none or one or the other.
Attributes Reference
The following attributes are exported:
id - ID of the Datadog downtime. On updates this can sometime change based on API logic. For recurring
downtimes it would be recommended to ignore_changes  on this field.
active  - If true this indicates the downtime is currently  active.disabled  - If true this indicates the downtime is currently  disabled.
Import
Downtimes can be imported using their numeric ID, e .g.

datadog_integration_pagerduty
Provides a Datadog - PagerDuty resource. This can b e used to create and manage Datadog - PagerDuty
integration. This resource is deprecated and should  only be used for legacy purposes.
Example Usage
Note:  Until terraform-provider-datadog version 2.1.0, se rvice objects under the services  key were specified inside
the datadog_integration_pagerduty  resource. This was incompatible with multi-configu ration-file setups, where
users wanted to have individual service objects con trolled from different Terraform configuration file s. The
recommended approach now is specifying service obje cts as individual resources using
datadog_integration_pagerduty_service_object
(/docs/providers/datadog/r/integration_pagerduty_se rvice_object.html) and adding individual_services =
true  to the datadog_integration_pagerduty  object.

Migrating from Inline Services to Individual Resour cesMigrating from usage of inline services to individu al resources is very simple. The following example shows how to
convert an existing inline services configuration t o configuration using individual resources. Doing a nalogous
change and running terraform apply  after every step is all that's necessary to migrat e.
# First step - this is what the configuration looke d like initially
locals {
  pd_services = {
    testing_foo = "9876543210123456789"
    testing_bar = "54321098765432109876"

# Second step - this will remove the inline-defined  service objects
# Note that during this step, `individual_services`  must not be defined

  # `services` was removed
  schedules = [

resource "datadog_integration_pagerduty" "pd" {
  # `individual_services = true` was added
  individual_services = true
  schedules = [
    "https://ddog.pagerduty.com/schedules/X123VF",

  service_key  = "54321098765432109876"
}
Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
individual_services  - (Optional) Boolean to specify whether or not ind ividual service objects specified by
datadog_integration_pagerduty_service_object
(/docs/providers/datadog/r/integration_pagerduty_se rvice_object.html) resource are to be used. Mutuall y
exclusive with services  key.
services  - (Optional) Array of PagerDuty service objects. Deprecated  The services  list is now deprecated in
favour of datadog_integration_pagerduty_service_obj ect
(/docs/providers/datadog/r/integration_pagerduty_se rvice_object.html) resource. Note that
individual_services  must be set to true  to ignore the service  attribute and use individual services
properly.
service_name  - (Required) Your Service name in PagerDuty.
service_key  - (Required) Your Service name associated service key in Pagerduty.

}
Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
service_name  - (Required) Your Service name in PagerDuty.
service_key  - (Required) Your Service name associated service key in PagerDuty. Note: Since the Datadog

Import
For the previously created custom pipelines, you ca n include them in Terraform with the import  operation.
Currently, Terraform requires you to explicitly cre ate resources that match the existing pipelines to import them. Use
terraform import <resource.name> <pipelineID>  for each existing pipeline.
Important Notes
Each datadog_logs_custom_pipeline  resource defines a complete pipeline. The order of  the pipelines is
maintained in a different resource datadog_logs_pip eline_order
(/docs/providers/datadog/r/logs_pipeline_order.html #datadog_logs_pipeline_order). When creating a new
pipeline, you need to explicitly  add this pipeline to the datadog_logs_pipeline_order  resource to track the
pipeline. Similarly, when a pipeline needs to be de stroyed, remove its references from the
datadog_logs_pipeline_order  resource.Write an infrastructure application in TypeScript a nd Python using CDK for TerraformLIVE

used to create and manage Datadog logs indexes.
Example Usage
A sample Datadog logs index resource definition. No te that at this point, it is not possible to create  new logs indexes
through Terraform, so the name  field must match a name of an already existing ind ex. If you want to keep the
current state of the index, we suggest importing it  (see below).

active.
name  - (Optional) The name of the exclusion filter.
is_enabled  - (Optional, default = false) A boolean stating if  the exclusion is active or not.
Import
The current Datadog Terraform provider version does  not support the creation and deletion of indexes. To manage
the existing indexes, do terraform import <datadog_logs_index.name> <indexNa me> to import them to Terraform.
If you create a resource which does not match the n ame of any existing index, terraform apply  will throw Not

the integrations (https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/l og_collection/?tab=tcpussite).
Integration pipelines are the pipelines that are au tomatically installed for your organization when se nding the logs
with specific sources. You don't need to maintain o r update these types of pipelines. Keeping them as resources,
however, allows you to manage the order of your pip elines by referencing them in your
datadog_logs_pipeline_order

  timeout_h    = 60
  include_tags = true
  
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [silenced]
  }
  tags = ["foo:bar", "baz"]
}
Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
type  - (Required) The type of the monitor. The mapping from these types to the types found in the Datadog
Web UI can be found in the Datadog API documentatio n
(https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/monitors/#create -a-monitor) page. The available options are below.
Note : The monitor type cannot be changed after a monito r is created.
metric alert
service check
event alert
query alert
composite
log alert
name  - (Required) Name of Datadog monitor
query  - (Required) The monitor query to notify on. Note this is not the same query you see in the UI and th e
syntax is different depending on the monitor type , please see the API Reference
(https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/monitors/#create -a-monitor) for details. Warning:  terraform plan
won't perform any validation of the query contents.
message  - (Required) A message to include with notificatio ns for this monitor. Email notifications can be sen t
to specific users by using the same '@username' not ation as events.
escalation_message  - (Optional) A message to include with a re-notifi cation. Supports the '@username'
notification allowed elsewhere.
thresholds  - (Optional)
Metric alerts: A dictionary of thresholds by thresh old type. Currently we have four threshold types fo r
metric alerts: critical, critical recovery, warning , and warning recovery. Critical is defined in the query, but
can also be specified in this option. Warning and r ecovery thresholds can only be specified using the
thresholds option. Example usage: thresholds = { critical = 90 critical_recovery = 85  warning
= 80 warning_recovery = 75 } Warning:  the critical  threshold value must match the one contained
in the query  argument. The threshold  from the previous example is valid along with a qu ery like
avg(last_1h):avg:system.disk.in_use{role:sqlserver}  by {host} > 90  but along with something
like avg(last_1h):avg:system.disk.in_use{role:sqlserver}  by {host} > 95  would make the
Datadog API return a HTTP error 400, complaining "T he value provided for parameter 'query' is invalid" .
Service checks: A dictionary of thresholds by statu s. Because service checks can have multiple
thresholds, we don't define them directly in the qu ery. Default values: thresholds = { ok = 1 critical
= 1 warning = 1 unknown = 1 }
notify_no_data  (Optional) A boolean indicating whether this monit or will notify when data stops reporting.
Defaults to false.
new_host_delay  (Optional) Time (in seconds) to allow a host to bo ot and applications to fully start before
starting the evaluation of monitor results. Should be a non negative integer. Defaults to 300.evaluation_delay  (Optional, only applies to metric alert) Time (in seconds) to delay evaluation, as a non-
negative integer. For example, if the value is set to 300 (5min), the timeframe is set to last_5m and the time is
7:00, the monitor will evaluate data from 6:50 to 6 :55. This is useful for AWS CloudWatch and other ba ckfilled
metrics to ensure the monitor will always have data  during evaluation.
no_data_timeframe  (Optional) The number of minutes before a monitor will notify when data stops reporting.
Provider defaults to 10 minutes. We recommend at le ast 2x the monitor timeframe for metric alerts or 2
minutes for service checks.
renotify_interval  (Optional) The number of minutes after the last no tification before a monitor will re-notify
on the current status. It will only re-notify if it 's not resolved.
notify_audit  (Optional) A boolean indicating whether tagged use rs will be notified on changes to this
monitor. Defaults to false.
timeout_h  (Optional) The number of hours of the monitor not reporting data before it will automatically
resolve from a triggered state. Defaults to false.
include_tags  (Optional) A boolean indicating whether notificati ons from this monitor automatically insert its
triggering tags into the title. Defaults to true.
enable_logs_sample  (Optional) A boolean indicating whether or not to include a list of log values which
triggered the alert. Defaults to false. This is onl y used by log monitors. triggering tags into the ti tle. Defaults to
true.
require_full_window  (Optional) A boolean indicating whether this monit or needs a full window of data
before it's evaluated. We highly recommend you set this to False for sparse metrics, otherwise some
evaluations will be skipped. Default: True for "on average", "at all times" and "in total" aggregation . False
otherwise.
locked  (Optional) A boolean indicating whether changes to  to this monitor should be restricted to the creato r
or admins. Defaults to False.
tags  (Optional) A list of tags to associate with your m onitor. This can help you categorize and filter mon itors
in the manage monitors page of the UI. Note: it's n ot currently possible to filter by these tags when querying via
the API
force_delete  (Optional) A boolean indicating whether this monit or can be deleted even if it’s referenced by
other resources (e.g. SLO, composite monitor).
threshold_windows  (Optional) A mapping containing recovery_window  and trigger_window  values, e.g.
last_15m . Can only be used for, and are required for, anoma ly monitors.
recovery_window  describes how long an anomalous metric must be nor mal before the alert recovers.
trigger_window  describes how long a metric must be anomalous befo re an alert triggers.
silenced  (Optional) Each scope will be muted until the give n POSIX timestamp or forever if the value is 0.
Use -1 if you want to unmute the scope. Deprecated  The silenced  parameter is being deprecated in favor
of the downtime resource. This will be removed in t he next major version of the Terraform Provider.To mute the alert completely:
silenced = {
  "*" =  0
}
To mute role:db for a short time:
silenced = {
  "role:db" = 1412798116
}
Note: due to HCL limitations (https://github.com/ha shicorp/terraform/issues/2042), it is impossible to  use
interpolations in keys. For example, the following will result in muting the scope role:${var:role}  (no
interpolation is done):
silenced = {
    "role:${var:role}" = 0
}
To workaround this, you can use the map function
(https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functi ons/map.html) of HCL:
silenced = ${map("role:${var:role}", 0)}
Silencing by Hand and by Downtimes
There are two ways how to silence a single monitor:
Mute it by hand
Create a Downtime
Both of these actions add a new value to the silenced  map. This can be problematic if the silenced  attribute
doesn't contain them in your Terraform, as they wou ld be removed on next terraform apply  invocation. In order to
prevent that from happening, you can add following to your monitor:
lifecycle {
  ignore_changes = [silenced]
}
The above will make sure that any changes to the silenced  attribute are ignored.
This issue doesn't apply to multi-monitor downtimes  (those that don't contain monitor_id ), as these don't influence
contents of the silenced  attribute.Attributes Reference
The following attributes are exported:
id - ID of the Datadog monitor
Import
Monitors can be imported using their numeric ID, e. g.
$ terraform import datadog_monitor.bytes_received_l ocalhost 2081
Composite Monitors
You can compose monitors of all types in order to d efine more specific alert conditions (see the doc
(https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/monitor_types/ composite/)). You just need to reuse the ID of your
datadog_monitor  resources. You can also compose any monitor with a  datadog_synthetics_test  by passing the
computed monitor_id  attribute in the query.
resource "datadog_monitor" "bar" {
  name = "Composite Monitor"
  type = "composite"
  message = "This is a message"
  query = "${datadog_monitor.foo.id} || ${datadog_synthetics _test.foo.monitor_id}"

present in the query. For example, this is how you define metadata_json  with Terraform >= 0.12:
metadata_json = jsonencode({ "avg:redis.info.latenc y_ms{$host}": { "alias": "Redis latency" } })
And here's how you define metadata_json  with Terraform < 0.12: ``` variable "my_metadata" { default = {
"avg:redis.info.latency_ms{$host}" = { "alias": "Re dis latency" } } }
resource "datadog_screenboard" "SomeScreenboard" { ... metadata_json = "${jsonencode(var.my_metadata)} " } ``
Note that this has to be a JSON blob because of [li mitations]
(https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/6215 ) of Terraform's handling complex nested
structures. This is also why the key is called metadata_json even though it sets metadata ` attribute on
the API call.

Synthetics Browser test
Support for Synthetics Browser test is limited to c reating shallow Synthetics Browser test (cf. exampl e usage below)
You cannot create/edit/delete steps or assertions v ia Terraform unless you use Datadog WebUI
(https://app.datadoghq.com/synthetics/list) in conj unction with Terraform.
We are considering adding support for Synthetics Br owser test steps and assertions in the future but c an't share
any release date on that matter.
Assertion format
The resource was changed to have assertions be a li st of assertion  blocks instead of single assertions  array, to
support the JSON path operations. We'll remove assertions  support in the future: to migrate, rename your
attribute to assertion  and turn array elements into independent blocks. F or example:
resource "datadog_synthetics_test" "test_api" {
  assertions = [
    {
      type = "statusCode"
      operator = "is"
      target = "200"
    },
    {
      type = "responseTime"
      operator = "lessThan"
      target = "1000"
    }
  ]
}
turns into:
resource "datadog_synthetics_test" "test_api" {
  assertion {
      type = "statusCode"
      operator = "is"
      target = "200"
  }
  assertion {
      type = "responsTime"
      operator = "lessThan"
      target = "1000"
  }

this block is described below. Multiple marker bloc ks are allowed within a graph block.
Nested graph  marker  blocks
Nested graph  marker  blocks have the following structure:
type  - (Required) How the marker lines will look. Possi ble values are {"error", "warning", "info", "ok"} { "dashed",
"solid", "bold"}. Example: "error dashed".
value  - (Required) Mathematical expression describing th e marker. Examples: "y > 1", "-5 < y < 0", "y = 19" .
label  - (Optional) A label for the line or range. Warning:  when a label is enabled but left empty through the
UI, the Datadog API returns a boolean value, not a string. This makes terraform plan  fail with a JSON
decoding error.
Nested graph  yaxis  block
min - (Optional) Minimum bound for the graph's yaxis, a string.
max - (Optional) Maximum bound for the graph's yaxis, a string.
scale  - (Optional) How to scale the yaxis. Possible valu es are: "linear", "log", "sqrt", "pow##" (eg. pow2,

process_query  is required within the request block):
q - (Optional) The query of the request. Pro tip: Us e the JSON tab inside the Datadog UI to help build you
query strings.
apm_query  - (Optional) The APM query to use in the widget. T he structure of this block is described below
(/docs/providers/datadog/r/timeboard.html#nested-gr aph-request-apm_query-and-log_query-blocks).

(/docs/providers/datadog/r/timeboard.html#nested-gr aph-request-apm_query-and-log_query-blocks).
process_query  - (Optional) The process query to use in the widge t. The structure of this block is described
below (/docs/providers/datadog/r/timeboard.html#nes ted-graph-request-process_query-blocks).
aggregator  - (Optional) The aggregation method used when the number of data points outnumbers the max
that can be shown.

be left empty otherwise.
metadata_json  - (Optional) A JSON blob (preferrably created usin g jsonencode
(https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functi ons/jsonencode.html)) representing mapping of query
expressions to alias names. Note that the query exp ressions in metadata_json  will be ignored if they're not
present in the query. For example, this is how you define metadata_json  with Terraform >= 0.12:
  metadata_json = jsonencode({
    "avg:redis.info.latency_ms{$host}": {
      "alias": "Redis latency"
    }
  })
And here's how you define metadata_json  with Terraform < 0.12:  variable "my_metadata" {
    default = {
      "avg:redis.info.latency_ms{$host}" = {
        "alias": "Redis latency"
      }
    }
  }
  resource "datadog_timeboard" "SomeTimeboard" {
    ...
        metadata_json = "${jsonencode(var.my_metada ta)}"
  }
Note that this has to be a JSON blob because of lim itations
(https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/6215 ) of Terraform's handling complex nested structures . This is
also why the key is called metadata_json  even though it sets metadata  attribute on the API call.
Nested graph  style  block
The nested style  block is used specifically for styling hostmap  graphs, and has the following structure:
fill_max  - (Optional) Maximum value for the hostmap fill qu ery.
fill_min  - (Optional) Minimum value for the hostmap fill qu ery.
palette  - (Optional) Spectrum of colors to use when stylin g a hostmap. For example: "green_to_orange",
"yellow_to_green", "YlOrRd", or "hostmap_blues". De fault: "green_to_orange".
palette_flip  - (Optional) Flip how the hostmap is rendered. For  example, with the default palette, low values
are represented as green, with high values as orang e. If palette_flip is "true", then low values will be orange,
and high values will be green.
Nested graph  request  style  block
The nested style  blocks has the following structure:
palette  - (Optional) Color of the line drawn. For example:  "classic", "cool", "warm", "purple", "orange" or " gray".

Dynamic Timeboards
Since Terraform 0.12, it's possible to create timeb oard graphs dynamically based on contents of a list /map variable.
This can be achieved by using the dynamic blocks
(https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/expres sions.html#dynamic-blocks) feature. For example:variable "my_list" {
  default = ["First", "Second", "Third"]
}
variable "my_map" {
  default = {
    "First" = "value1"
    "Second" = "value2"
  }
}
# Create a timeboard with "First", "Second" and "Th ird" timeseries graphs
resource "datadog_timeboard" "my_timeboard" {
  title       = "My Timeboard"
  description = "My Description"
  read_only   = true
  dynamic "graph" {
    for_each = var.my_list
    content {
      title = "${graph.value}"
      viz = "timeseries"
      request {
        q = "anomalies(sum:mycount{adapter:${graph. value}}.as_count().rollup(sum, 3600), 'robust', 4, 
direction='below')"
      }
    }
  }
}
# Create a timeboard with "First" and "Second" time series graphs, use map keys as titles and map value
s as adapter names
resource "datadog_timeboard" "my_timeboard_map" {
  title       = "My Timeboard From Map"
  description = "My Description"
  read_only   = true
  dynamic "graph" {
    for_each = var.my_map
    content {
      title = "${graph.key}"
      viz = "timeseries"
      request {
        q = "anomalies(sum:mycount{adapter:${graph. value}}.as_count().rollup(sum, 3600), 'robust', 4,

Provider prismacloud
This provider is for the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud platform.
Example Provider Usage
provider "prismacloud" {

}
Argument Reference
There are multiple ways to specify provider config,  and they may all be combined if desired. The param s are taken
from the following locations, in order of preferenc e:
1) Any param specified explicitly in the provider  block 2) From the param's environment variable, wh ere
applicable. 3) From the JSON config file, if specif ied.
When retrieving params from the JSON configuration file, the param names are the same as the provider params,
except that underscores in provider params become h yphens in the JSON config file. For example, the pr ovider
param json_web_token  is json-web-token  in the config file.
The following arguments are supported:
url - (Env: PRISMACLOUD_URL ) The API URL without the leading protocol.
username  - (Env: PRISMACLOUD_USERNAME ) Access key ID.
password  - (Env: PRISMACLOUD_PASSWORD ) Secret key.

verification.
logging  - Map of logging options for the API connection. V alid values are quiet  (disable logging), action ,
path , send , and receive .
disable_reconnect  - (bool) Prisma Cloud invalidates authenticated se ssions after 10minutes. By default the
provider will silently get a new JSON web token and  continue deploying the plan. If you do not want th e
provider to fetch a new JSON web token, set this to  true .
json_web_token  - (Env: PRISMACLOUD_JSON_WEB_TOKEN ) A JSON web token. These are only valid for 10
minutes once issued. If this is specified but not t he username  / password  then the provider will not have a
way to reauthenticate once the JSON web token expir es.
json_config_file  - (Env: PRISMACLOUD_JSON_CONFIG_FILE ) Retrieve the provider configuration from this
JSON file.

Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI)
The Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) allows application requirements to define the netwo rk. This
architecture simplifies, optimizes, and accelerates  the entire application deployment life cycle.
Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)
The APIC manages the scalable ACI multi-tenant fabr ic. The APIC provides a unified point of automation  and
management, policy programming, application deploym ent, and health monitoring for the fabric. The APIC , which is
implemented as a replicated synchronized clustered controller, optimizes performance, supports any app lication
anywhere, and provides unified operation of the phy sical and virtual infrastructure. The APIC enables network
administrators to easily define the optimal network  for applications. Data center operators can clearl y see how
applications consume network resources, easily isol ate and troubleshoot application and infrastructure  problems,
and monitor and profile resource usage patterns. Th e Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controlle r (APIC) API
enables applications to directly connect with a sec ure, shared, high-performance resource pool that in cludes
network, compute, and storage capabilities.
Cisco ACI Provider
The Cisco ACI terraform provider is used to interac t with resources provided by Cisco APIC. The provid er needs to
be configured with proper credentials to authentica te with Cisco APIC.
Authentication
The Provider supports authentication with Cisco API C in 2 ways:
1. Authentication with user-id and password.
example:
 provider "aci" {
    
    username = "admin"
    
    password = "password"
    
    url      = "https://my-cisco-aci.com"
    insecure = true
}
In this method, it will obtain an authentication to ken from Cisco APIC and will use that token to auth enticate. A
limitation with this approach is APIC counts the re quest to authenticate and threshold it to avoid DOS  attack. After
too many attempts this authentication method may fa il as the threshold will be exceeded.
To avoid the above-mentioned problem Cisco APIC sup ports signature-based authentication.
1. Signature Based authentication.
x509 certificate has been created and added it to t he user in Cisco APIC.
With the help of private key that has been used to calculate the certificate, a signature has been
calculated and passed with the request. This signat ure will be used to authenticate the user.
example.
    provider "aci" {
        # cisco-aci user name
        username = "admin"
        # private key path
        private_key = "path to private key"
        # Certificate Name
        cert_name = "certificate.crt"
        # cisco-aci url
        url      = "https://my-cisco-aci.com"
        insecure = true
    }
How to add Certiﬁcate to the Cisco APIC local user
Generate certificate via below command.
$ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:1024 -days 36500 -no des -x509 -keyout admin.key -out admin.crt -su
bj '/CN=Admin/O=Your Company/C=US'
Add the X.509 certificate to your ACI AAA local use r at ADMIN » AAA.
Click AAA Authentication. Check that in the Authent ication field the Realm field displays Local.
Expand Security Management » Local Users Click the name of the user you want to add a certificate to, in the
User Certificates area Click the + sign and in the Create X509 Certificate enter a certificate name in  the Name
field. Copy and paste your X.509 certificate in the  Data field.
Example Usageprovider "aci" {
  
  username = "admin"
  
  password = "password"
  
  url      = "https://my-cisco-aci.com"
  insecure = true
}
resource "aci_tenant" "test-tenant" {
  name        = "test-tenant"
  description = "This tenant is created by terraform"
}

  tanent_dn   = "${aci_tenant.test-tenant.id}"
  name        = "test-app"
  description = "This app profile is created by terraform"
}
Argument Reference
Following arguments are supported with Cisco ACI te rraform provider.
username  - (Required) This is the Cisco APIC username, whic h is required to authenticate with CISCO APIC.
password  - (Optional) Password of the user mentioned in use rname argument. It is required when you want

Attribute Reference
id - Attribute id set to the Dn of the OSPF Interface  Policy.
annotation  - (Optional) annotation for object ospf_interface_ policy.
cost  - (Optional) The OSPF cost for the interface. The cost (also called metric) of an interface in OSPF i s an
indication of the overhead required to send packets  across a certain interface. The cost of an interfa ce is
inversely proportional to the bandwidth of that int erface. A higher bandwidth indicates a lower cost. There is
more overhead (higher cost) and time delays involve d in crossing a 56k serial line than crossing a 10M
ethernet line. The formula used to calculate the co st is: cost= 10000 0000/bandwidth in bps For exampl e, it
will cost 10 EXP8/10 EXP7 = 10 to cross a 10M Ether net line and will cost 10 EXP8/1544000 = 64 to cros s
a T1 line. By default, the cost of an interface is calculated based on the bandwidth; you can force th e cost of
an interface with the ip ospf cost value interface sub-configuration mode command.
ctrl  - (Optional) interface policy controls
dead_intvl  - (Optional) The interval between hello packets fr om a neighbor before the router declares the
neighbor as down. This value must be the same for a ll networking devices on a specific network. Specif ying a
smaller dead interval (seconds) will give faster de tection of a neighbor being down and improve conver gence,
but might cause more routing instability.hello_intvl  - (Optional) The interval between hello packets th at OSPF sends on the interface. Note that the
smaller the hello interval, the faster topological changes will be detected, but more routing traffic will ensue.
This value must be the same for all routers and acc ess servers on a specific network.
name_alias  - (Optional) name_alias for object ospf_interface_ policy.
nw_t  - (Optional) The OSPF interface policy network typ e. OSPF supports point-to-point and broadcast.
pfx_suppress  - (Optional) pfx-suppression for object ospf_inter face_policy.
prio  - (Optional) The OSPF interface priority used to d etermine the designated router (DR) on a specific
network. The router with the highest OSPF priority on a segment will become the DR for that segment. T he
same process is repeated for the backup designated router (BDR). In the case of a tie, the router with  the
highest RID will win. The default for the interface  OSPF priority is one. Remember that the DR and BDR
concepts are per multiaccess segment.
rexmit_intvl  - (Optional) The interval between LSA retransmissi ons. The retransmit interval occurs while the
router is waiting for an acknowledgement from the n eighbor router that it received the LSA. If no
acknowlegment is received at the end of the interva l, then the LSA is resent.
xmit_delay  - (Optional) The delay time needed to send an LSA update packet. OSPF increments the LSA age
time by the transmit delay amount before transmitti ng the LSA update. You should take into account the
transmission and propagation delays for the interfa ce when you set this value.Write an infrastructure application in TypeScript a nd Python using CDK for TerraformLIVE

aci_ospf_interface_policy
Manages ACI OSPF Interface Policy
Example Usage
    resource "aci_ospf_interface_policy" "fooospf_i nterface_policy" {
        tenant_dn    = "${aci_tenant.dev_tenant.id}"
        description  = "%s"

        rexmit_intvl = "5"
        xmit_delay   = "1"
    }
Argument Reference
tenant_dn  - (Required) Distinguished name of parent Tenant o bject.
name  - (Required) name of Object ospf_interface_policy.
annotation  - (Optional) annotation for object ospf_interface_ policy.
cost  - (Optional) The OSPF cost for the interface. The cost (also called metric) of an interface in OSPF i s an
indication of the overhead required to send packets  across a certain interface. The cost of an interfa ce is
inversely proportional to the bandwidth of that int erface. A higher bandwidth indicates a lower cost. There is
more overhead (higher cost) and time delays involve d in crossing a 56k serial line than crossing a 10M
ethernet line. The formula used to calculate the co st is: cost= 10000 0000/bandwidth in bps For exampl e, it
will cost 10 EXP8/10 EXP7 = 10 to cross a 10M Ether net line and will cost 10 EXP8/1544000 = 64 to cros s
a T1 line. By default, the cost of an interface is calculated based on the bandwidth; you can force th e cost of
an interface with the ip ospf cost value interface sub-configuration mode command. Allowed value range  is
"0" - "65535". Default is "unspecified(0)".
ctrl  - (Optional) interface policy controls. Allowed va lues are "unspecified", "passive", "mtu-ignore", "a dvert-subnet" and "bfd". Default is "unspecified".
dead_intvl  - (Optional) The interval between hello packets fr om a neighbor before the router declares the
neighbor as down. This value must be the same for a ll networking devices on a specific network. Specif ying a
smaller dead interval (seconds) will give faster de tection of a neighbor being down and improve conver gence,
but might cause more routing instability. Allowed v alue range is "1" - "65535". Default value is "40".
hello_intvl  - (Optional) The interval between hello packets th at OSPF sends on the interface. Note that the
smaller the hello interval, the faster topological changes will be detected, but more routing traffic will ensue.
This value must be the same for all routers and acc ess servers on a specific network. Allowed value ra nge is
"1" - "65535". Default value is "10".
name_alias  - (Optional) name_alias for object ospf_interface_ policy.
nw_t  - (Optional) The OSPF interface policy network typ e. OSPF supports point-to-point and broadcast.
Allowed values are "unspecified", "p2p" and "bcast" . Default value is "unspecified".
pfx_suppress  - (Optional) pfx-suppression for object ospf_inter face_policy. Allowed values are "inherit",
"enable" and "disable". Default value is "inherit".
prio  - (Optional) The OSPF interface priority used to d etermine the designated router (DR) on a specific
network. The router with the highest OSPF priority on a segment will become the DR for that segment. T he
same process is repeated for the backup designated router (BDR). In the case of a tie, the router with  the
highest RID will win. The default for the interface  OSPF priority is one. Remember that the DR and BDR
concepts are per multiaccess segment. Allowed value  range is "0" - "255". Default value is "1".
rexmit_intvl  - (Optional) The interval between LSA retransmissi ons. The retransmit interval occurs while the
router is waiting for an acknowledgement from the n eighbor router that it received the LSA. If no
acknowlegment is received at the end of the interva l, then the LSA is resent. Allowed value range is " 1" -
"65535". Default value is "5".
xmit_delay  - (Optional) The delay time needed to send an LSA update packet. OSPF increments the LSA age
time by the transmit delay amount before transmitti ng the LSA update. You should take into account the
transmission and propagation delays for the interfa ce when you set this value. Allowed value range is "1" -
"450". Default is "1".

View on Terraform Registry
(https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/ tfe/)
Terraform Enterprise Provider
The Terraform Enterprise provider is used to intera ct with the many resources supported by Terraform E nterprise
(https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform). It supports both the SaaS version of Terraform Enterpr ise
(app.terraform.io (https://app.terraform.io)) and p rivate instances.
Use the navigation to the left to read about the av ailable resources.
Important:  For production use, you should constrain the accep table provider versions via configuration, to
ensure that new versions with breaking changes will  not be automatically installed. For more informati on, see
Versions.
Authentication
This provider requires a Terraform Enterprise API t oken in order to manage resources.
To manage the full selection of resources, provide a user token (/docs/cloud/users-teams-
organizations/users.html#api-tokens) from an accoun t with appropriate permissions. This user should be long to
the "owners" team of every Terraform Enterprise org anization you wish to manage.
Note:  You can use an organization or team token (/docs/c loud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html)
instead of a user token, but it will limit which re sources you can manage. Organization and team token s cannot
manage resources across multiple organizations, and  organization tokens cannot manage certain resource
types (like SSH keys). See the Terraform Enterprise  API documentation (/docs/cloud/api/index.html) for  more
details about access to specific resources.
There are a few ways to provide the required token:
Setting the TFE_TOKEN  environment variable: The provider can read the TFE_TOKEN  environment variable and
the token stored there to authenticate. Please note  that if you are using Terraform Cloud or Terraform
Enterprise, you will need to set the TFE_TOKEN  environment variable in your workspace, even if yo u're using
the remote  backend.
Using terraform login  to generate credentials: On the CLI you can use th e credentials generated by
terraform login  (https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/login.html ) by setting the value of the
environment variable TERRAFORM_CONFIG  to the location of the file created (for example~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json  on Linux systems).
Setting a credentials  block in your CLI config file: On the CLI you can omit the token  argument from your
Terraform config and set a credentials  block in your CLI config file (/docs/commands/cli-
config.html#credentials).
Setting the token  argument in the provider configuration: In a Terra form Cloud or Terraform Enterprise
workspace you can set token  in the provider configuration. Use an input variab le for the token and mark the
corresponding variable in the workspace as sensitiv e.
Versions
For production use, you should constrain the accept able provider versions via configuration, to ensure  that new
versions with breaking changes will not be automati cally installed by terraform init  in future. As this provider is
still at version zero, you should constrain the acc eptable provider versions on the minor version.
If you are using Terraform CLI version 0.12.x, you can constrain this provider to 0.15.x versions by a dding a
required_providers  block inside a terraform  block.
terraform {
  required_providers {
    tfe = "~> 0.15.0"
  }
}
If you are using Terraform CLI version 0.11.x, you can constrain this provider to 0.15.x versions by a dding the
version constraint to the tfe provider block.
provider "tfe" {
  version = "~> 0.15.0"
  ...
}
For more information on constraining provider versi ons, see the provider versions documentation
(https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/provid ers.html#provider-versions).
Example Usageprovider "tfe" {
  hostname = "${var.hostname}"
  token    = "${var.token}"
  version  = "~> 0.15.0"
}
resource "tfe_organization" "org" {
  
}
Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
hostname  - (Optional) The Terraform Enterprise hostname to connect to. Defaults to app.terraform.io . Can
be overridden by setting the TFE_HOSTNAME  environment variable.
token  - (Optional) The token used to authenticate with T erraform Enterprise. Only set this argument when

remote state storage, permissions, integrations, po licies, and more.
Gain productivity by defining a repeatable process
Set up your ideal remote workspaces so that other teams or  systems can safely
provision infrastructure in automation.Plan and provision with confidence
Create checks in order for a run to pass. Add funct ionality into Terraform
plans with run tasks, policy as code, or cost estim ation.
Integrate with your existing provisioning pipeline
Provision in automation by integrating with your CI/CD pipeline, and send notifications
to other systems with each apply.
When infrastructure changes are applied, your state file will be dynamically updated.
Scale with your team
Provision infrastructure securely and reliably in t he cloud with free remote
state storage. As you scale, add workspaces to brea k up monolithic
infrastructure or manage more projects.Build infrastructure remotely with your team
Collaborate in a remote and SOC2 compliant environm ent.
Remote state storage
Store and dynamically update your
Terraform state file securely with
encryption at rest.
Flexible workflows
Run Terraform from the CLI, a UI,
version control, or the API.

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and version ing infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can m anage
existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-h ouse solutions.
The key features of Terraform are:
Infrastructure as Code : Infrastructure is described using a high-level configurat ion syntax. This allows a
blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treate d as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure
can be shared and re-used. Star

Execution Plans : Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates a n execution plan . The execution plan
shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This le ts you avoid any surprises when Terraform
manipulates infrastructure.
Resource Graph : Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and pa rallelizes the creation and modification
of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and
operators get insight into dependencies in their infrast ructure.
Change Automation : Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction.
With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change
and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.
For more information, see the introduction section  of the Terraform website.
Getting Started & Documentation
Documentation is available on the Terraform website :
Intro
Docs
If you're new to Terraform and want to get started cre ating infrastructure, please check out our Getting Started guides
on HashiCorp's learning platform. There are also additional guides  to continue your learning.
Show off your Terraform knowledge by passing a certificatio n exam. Visit the certification page  for information about
exams and find study materials  on HashiCorp's learning platform.
Developing Terraform
This repository contains only Terraform core, which includes the command line interface and the main graph engine.
Providers are implemented as plugins, and Terraform can a utomatically download providers that are published on the
Terraform Registry . HashiCorp develops some providers, and others are develop ed by other organizations. For more
information, see Extending Terraform .

Packet Provider
The Packet provider is used to interact with the re sources supported by Packet. The provider needs to be
configured with the proper credentials before it ca n be used.
Use the navigation to the left to read about the av ailable resources.
Be cautious when using the packet_project  resource. Packet is invoicing per project, so crea ting man new
projects will cause your Packet bill to fragment. I f you want to keep your Packet bill simple, please re-use your
existing projects.
Example Usage
provider "packet" {
  auth_token = var. auth_token
}
locals {
  project_id = "<UUID_of_your_project>"
}
resource "packet_device" "web1" {
  hostname         = "web1"
  plan             = "c1.small.x86"
  facilities         = ["ewr1"]

Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
hostname  - (Required) The device name
project_id  - (Required) The ID of the project in which to cre ate the device
operating_system  - (Required) The operating system slug. To find th e slug, or visit Operating Systems API
docs (https://www.packet.com/developers/api/operati ngsystems), set your API auth token in the top of t he
page and see JSON from the API response.
facilities  - List of facility codes with deployment preferenc es. Packet API will go through the list and will
deploy your device to first facility with free capa city. List items must be facility codes or any (a wildcard). To
find the facility code, visit Facilities API docs ( https://www.packet.com/developers/api/facilities), set your API
auth token in the top of the page and see JSON from  the API response.
plan  - (Required) The device plan slug. To find the pla n slug, visit Device plans API docs
(https://www.packet.com/developers/api/plans), set your auth token in the top of the page and see JSON
from the API response.
billing_cycle  - (Required) monthly or hourly
user_data  (Optional) - A string of the desired User Data for  the device.
ipxe_script_url  (Optional) - URL pointing to a hosted iPXE script.  More information is in the Custom iPXE
(https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/servers/ope rating-systems/custom-ipxe/) doc.
always_pxe  (Optional) - If true, a device with OS custom_ipxe  will continue to boot via iPXE on reboots.hardware_reservation_id  (Optional) - The full ID  of the hardware reservation where you want this de vice
deployed, or next-available  if you want to pick your next available reservatio n automatically. Please be
careful when using hw reservation UUID and next-available  together for the same pool of resevations. It
might happen that the reservation which Packet API will pick as next-available  is the reservation which you
refer with UUID in another packet_device resource. If that happens, and the packet_device with the UUI D is
created later, resource creation will fail because the reservation is already in use (by the resource created with
next-available ). To workaround this, have the next-available  resource explicitly depend_on
(https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-star ted/dependencies.html#implicit-and-explicit-
dependencies) the resource with hw reservation UUID , so that the latter is created first. For more det ails, see
issue #176 (https://github.com/terraform-providers/ terraform-provider-packet/issues/176).
storage  (Optional) - JSON for custom partitioning. Only us able on reserved hardware. More information in in
the Custom Partitioning and RAID (https://www.packe t.com/developers/docs/servers/key-features/cpr/)
doc.
Please note that the disks.partitions.size attribut e must be a string, not an integer. It can be a num ber
string, or size notation string, e.g. "4G" or "8M" (for gigabytes and megabytes).
tags  - Tags attached to the device
description  - Description string for the device
project_ssh_key_ids  - Array of IDs of the project SSH keys which shoul d be added to the device. If you omit
this, SSH keys of all the members of the parent pro ject will be added to the device. If you specify th is array,
only the listed project SSH keys will be added. Pro ject SSH keys can be created with the
[packet_project_ssh_key][https://www.terraform.io/d ocs/providers/packet/r/project_ssh_key.html
(https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/packet/r/p roject_ssh_key.html)] resource.
ip_address  (Optional) - A list of IP address types for the de vice (structure is documented below).
wait_for_reservation_deprovision  (Optional) - Only used for devices in reserved har dware. If set, the
deletion of this device will block until the hardwa re reservation is marked provisionable (about 4 min utes in
August 2019).
force_detach_volumes  (Optional) - Delete device even if it has volumes attached. Only applies for destroy
action.
The ip_address  block has 3 fields:
type  - One of [ private_ipv4 , public_ipv4 , public_ipv6 ]
cidr  - CIDR suffix for IP address block to be assigned,  i.e. amount of addresses.
reservation_ids  - String of UUID of IP block reservations
(https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/packet/r/r eserved_ip_block.html) from which the public IPv4
address should be taken.
You can supply one ip_address  block per IP address type. If you use the ip_address  you must always pass a
block for private_ipv4 .To learn more about using the reserved IP addresses  for new devices, see the examples in the
packet_reserved_ip_block (https://www.terraform.io/ docs/providers/packet/r/reserved_ip_block.html)
documentation.

packet_reserved_ip_block
Provides a resource to create and manage blocks of reserved IP addresses in a project.
When a user provisions first device in a facility, Packet API automatically allocates IPv6/56 and priv ate IPv4/25
blocks. The new device then gets IPv6 and private I Pv4 addresses from those block. It also gets a publ ic IPv4/31
address. Every new device in the project and facili ty will automatically get IPv6 and private IPv4 add resses from
these pre-allocated blocks. The IPv6 and private IP v4 blocks can't be created, only imported. With thi s resource, it's
possible to create either public IPv4 blocks or glo bal IPv4 blocks.
Public blocks are allocated in a facility. Addresse s from public blocks can only be assigned to device s in the facility.
Public blocks can have mask from /24 (256 addresses ) to /32 (1 address). If you create public block wi th this
resource, you must fill the facility argmument.
Addresses from global blocks can be assigned in any  facility. Global blocks can have mask from /30 (4 addresses),
to /32 (1 address). If you create global block with  this resource, you must specify type = "global_ipv 4" and you
must omit the facility argument.
Once IP block is allocated or imported, an address from it can be assigned to device with the
packet_ip_attachment  resource.
Example Usage
Allocate reserved IP blocks:
resource "packet_reserved_ip_block" "two_elastic_ad dresses" {
  project_id = local. project_id
  facility = "ewr1"
  quantity = 2
}
resource "packet_reserved_ip_block" "test" {
  project_id = local. project_id
  type     = "global_ipv4"
  quantity = 1
}`
Allocate a block and run a device with public IPv4 from the block
resource "packet_reserved_ip_block" "example" {
  project_id = local. project_id
  facility = "ewr1"
  quantity = 2
}
resource "packet_device" "nodes" {
  project_id       = local. project_id

packet_volume_attachment
Provides attachment of Packet Block Storage Volume to Devices.
Device and volume must be in the same location (fac ility).
Once attached by Terraform, they must then be mount ed using the packet-block-storage-attach  and packet-
block-storage-detach  scripts, which are presinstalled on most OS images . They can also be found in
https://github.com/packethost/packet-block-storage (https://github.com/packethost/packet-block-storage ).
Example Usage
Follwing example will create a device, a volume, an d then it will attach the volume to the device over  the API.

OpenStack service. Setting an override requires you  to specify the full and complete endpoint URL. Thi s might
also invalidate any region you have set, too. Pleas e see below for more details. Please use this at yo ur own risk.
swauth  - (Optional) Set to true  to authenticate against Swauth, a Swift-native aut hentication system. If
omitted, the OS_SWAUTH  environment variable is used. You must also set username  to the Swauth/Swift
username such as username:project . Set the password  to the Swauth/Swift key. Finally, set auth_url  as the
location of the Swift service. Note that this will only work when used with the OpenStack Object Stora ge
resources.
use_octavia  - (Optional) If set to true , API requests will go the Load Balancer service (O ctavia) instead of
the Networking service (Neutron).
disable_no_cache_header  - (Optional) If set to true , the HTTP Cache-Control: no-cache  header will not be
added by default to all API requests. If omitted th is header is added to all API requests to force HTT P caches
(if any) to go upstream instead of serving cached r esponses.
delayed_auth  - (Optional) If set to false , OpenStack authorization will be perfomed, every t ime the service
provider client is called. Defaults to true .
allow_reauth  - (Optional) If set to false , OpenStack authorization won't be perfomed automat ically, if the
initial auth token get expired. Defaults to true .
Overriding Service API Endpoints
There might be a situation in which you want or nee d to override an API endpoint rather than use the e ndpoint
which was returned to you in the service catalog. Y ou can do this by configuring the endpoint_overrides
argument in the provider configuration:
provider "openstack" {
  endpoint_overrides = {
    "network"  = "https://example.com:9696/v2.0/"
    "volumev2" = "https://volumes.example.com:8776/v2/3eb25ae78e7b4 2d68276e9bca66c8e44/"
  }
}Note how each URL ends in a "/" and the volumev2  service includes the tenant/project UUID. You must  make sure
you specify the full and complete endpoint URL for this to work.
The service keys are the standard service entries u sed in the OpenStack Identity/Keystone service cata log. This
provider supports:
compute : Compute / Nova v2
container-infra : Container Infra / Magnum v1
database : Database / Trove v1
dns: DNS / Designate v2
identity : Identity / Keystone v3
image : Image / Glance v2
network : Networking / Neutron v2
object-store : Object Storage / Swift v1
octavia : Load Balancing as a Service / Octavia v2
sharev2 : Shared Filesystem / Manila v2
volume : Block Storage / Cinder v1
volumev2 : Block Storage / Cinder v2
volumev3 : Block Storage / Cinder v3
Please use this feature at your own risk. If you ar e unsure about needing to override an endpoint, you  most likely do
not need to override one.
Additional Logging
This provider has the ability to log all HTTP reque sts and responses between Terraform and the OpenSta ck cloud
which is useful for troubleshooting and debugging.
To enable these logs, set the OS_DEBUG  environment variable to 1 along with the usual TF_LOG=DEBUG  environment
variable:
$ OS_DEBUG =1 TF_LOG =DEBUG terraform apply
If you submit these logs with a bug report, please ensure any sensitive information has been scrubbed first!
OpenStack Releases and VersionsThis provider aims to support "vanilla" OpenStack. This means that we do all testing and development u sing the
official upstream OpenStack code. If your OpenStack  environment has patches or modifications, we do ou r best to
accommodate these modifications, but we can't guara ntee this.
We try to support all releases of OpenStack when we can. If your OpenSta ck cloud is running an older release, we
still should be able to support it.
Rackspace Compatibility
Using this OpenStack provider with Rackspace is not  supported and not guaranteed to work; however, use rs have
reported success with the following notes in mind:
Interacting with instances and networks has been se en to work. Interacting with all other resources is  either
untested or known to not work.
Use your password  instead of your Rackspace API KEY.
To use networks, override the endpoint in your prov ider configuration
provider "openstack" {
  user_name = "your-username"
  password  = "your-password"
  tenant_id = "your-tenant-id"
  region    = "IAD"
  auth_url  = "https://identity.api.rackspacecloud. com/v2.0/"
  endpoint_overrides = {
    "network" = "https://iad.networks.api.rackspace cloud.com/v2.0/"
  }
}
Explicitly define the public and private networks i n your instances as shown below:
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "my_instan ce" {
  name      = "my_instance"
  region    = "DFW"
  image_id  = "fabe045f-43f8-4991-9e6c-5cabd617538c "
  flavor_id = "general1-4"
  key_pair  = "provisioning_key"
  network {
    uuid = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    name = "public"
  }
  network {
    uuid = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
    name = "private"
  }
}If you try using this provider with Rackspace and r un into bugs, you are welcomed to open a bug report  / issue on
Github, but please keep in mind that this is unsupp orted and the reported bug may not be able to be fi xed.
If you have successfully used this provider with Ra ckspace and can add any additional comments, please  let us
know.
Testing and Development
Thank you for your interest in further developing t he OpenStack provider! Here are a few notes which s hould help
you get started. If you have any questions or feel these notes need further details, please open an Is sue and let us
know.
Coding and Style
This provider aims to adhere to the coding style an d practices used in the other major Terraform Provi ders.
However, this is not a strict rule.
We're very mindful that not everyone is a full-time  developer (most of the OpenStack Provider contribu tors aren't!)
and we're happy to provide guidance. Don't be afrai d if this is your first contribution to the OpenSta ck provider or
even your first contribution to an open source proj ect!
Testing Environment
In order to start fixing bugs or adding features, y ou need access to an OpenStack environment. If it i s safe to do, you
can use a production OpenStack cloud which you have  access to. However, it's usually safer to work in a
development cloud.
DevStack (https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/lates t/) is a quick and easy way to spin up an OpenStack  cloud.
All OpenStack services have DevStack plugins so you  can build a DevStack environment to test everythin g from
Nova/Compute to Designate/DNS.
Fully configuring a DevStack installation is outsid e the scope of this document; however, we'll try to  provide
assistance where we can.
Gophercloud
This provider uses Gophercloud (https://github.com/ gophercloud/gophercloud) as the Go OpenStack SDK. A ll
API interaction between this provider and an OpenSt ack cloud is done exclusively with Gophercloud.
Adding a FeatureIf you'd like to add a new feature to this provider , it must first be supported in Gophercloud. If Gop hercloud is
missing the feature, then it'll first have to be ad ded there before you can start working on the featu re in Terraform.
Fortunately, most of the regular OpenStack Provider  contributors also work on Gophercloud, so we can t ry to get
the feature added quickly.
If the feature is already included in Gophercloud, then you can begin work directly in the OpenStack p rovider.
If you have any questions about whether Gophercloud  currently supports a certain feature, please feel free to ask
and we can verify for you.
Fixing a Bug
Similarly, if you find a bug in this provider, the bug might actually be a Gophercloud bug. If this is  the case, then we'll
need to get the bug fixed in Gophercloud first.
However, if the bug is with Terraform itself, then you can begin work directly in the OpenStack provid er.
Again, if you have any questions about whether the bug you're trying to fix is a Gophercloud but, plea se ask.
Vendoring
If you require pulling in changes from an external package, such as Gophercloud, this provider uses Go  Modules
(https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
Acceptance Tests
Acceptance Tests are a crucial part of adding featu res or fixing a bug. Please make sure to read the c ore testing
(https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/testing/index .html) documentation for more information about how
Acceptance Tests work.
In order to run the Acceptance Tests, you'll need t o set the following environment variables:
OS_IMAGE_ID  or OS_IMAGE_NAME  - a UUID or name of an existing image in Glance.
OS_FLAVOR_ID  or OS_FLAVOR_NAME  - an ID or name of an existing flavor.
OS_POOL_NAME  - The name of a Floating IP pool. In DevStack, thi s is called public  and you should set this
value to the word public .
OS_NETWORK_ID  - The UUID of the private network in your test env ironment. In DevStack, this network is called
private  and you should set this value to the UUID of the private  network.
OS_EXTGW_ID  - The UUID of the public network in your test envi ronment. In DevStack, this network is called
public  and you should set this value to the UUID of the public  network.
The following additional environment variables migh t be required depending on the feature or bug you'r e testing:OS_DB_ENVIRONMENT  - Required if you're working on the openstack_db_*  resources. Set this value to "1" to
enable testing these resources.
OS_DB_DATASTORE_VERSION  - Required if you need to set a Trove/Database dat astore version.
OS_DB_DATASTORE_TYPE  - Required if you need to set a Trove/Database dat astore type.
OS_DNS_ENVIRONMENT  - Required if you're working on the openstack_dns_*  resources. Set this value to "1" to
enable testing these resources.
OS_SWIFT_ENVIRONMENT  - Required if you're working on an openstack_objectstorage_*  resource. Set this
value to "1" to enable testing these resources.
OS_LB_ENVIRONMENT  - Required if you're working on the openstack_lb_*  resources. Set this value to "1" to
enable testing these resources.
OS_FW_ENVIRONMENT  - Required if you're working on the openstack_fw_*  resources. Set this value to "1" to
enable testing these resources.
OS_VPN_ENVIRONMENT  - Required if your'e working on the openstack_vpn_*  resources. Set this value to "1" to
enable testing these resources.
OS_SFS_ENVIRONMENT  - Required if your'e working on the openstack_openstack_sharedfilesystem_*
resources. Set this value to "1" to enable testing these resources.
We recommend only running the acceptance tests rela ted to the feature or bug you're working on. To do this, run:
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/ter raform-provider-openstack
$ make testacc TEST =./openstack TESTARGS ="-run=<keyword> -count=1"
Where <keyword>  is the full name or partial name of a test. For ex ample:
$ make testacc TEST =./openstack TESTARGS ="-run=TestAccComputeV2Keypair_basic -count=1"
We recommend running tests with logging set to DEBUG :
$ TF_LOG =DEBUG make testacc TEST =./openstack TESTARGS ="-run=TestAccComputeV2Keypair_basic -count=1"
And you can even enable OpenStack debugging to see the actual HTTP API requests:
$ TF_LOG =DEBUG OS_DEBUG =1 make testacc TEST =./openstack TESTARGS ="-run=TestAccComputeV2Keypair_bas
ic -count=1"
Creating a Pull RequestWhen you're ready to submit a Pull Request, create a branch, commit your code, and push to your forked  version of
terraform-provider-openstack :
$ git remote add my-github-username https://github. com/my-github-username/terraform-provider-openstac
k
$ git checkout -b my-feature
$ git add .
$ git commit
$ git push -u my-github-username my-feature
Then navigate to https://github.com/terraform-provi ders/terraform-provider-openstack
(https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-p rovider-openstack) and create a Pull Request.
OpenLab Testing
Once you have created a Pull Request, it will autom atically be tested by OpenLab (https://openlabtesti ng.org/).
OpenLab will run most of the Acceptance Tests in a clean OpenStack cloud (see below for the resources which you
must tell OpenLab to run). Testing will take betwee n 90-120 minutes and you will receive a notificatio n with a test
report when testing has finished.
If there were any failures, check the provided logs .
There are a few reasons for test failures:
1. Your code changes worked in your environment but  are not working in a different OpenStack environme nt.
2. Your code changes caused another test to fail.
3. OpenLab is having issues.
If you are unable to determine why the failures hap pened, please ask and we'll look into the cause.
The OpenLab integration has a few keywords that you  can use to retest your code. Simply make a comment  in your
Pull Request with one of the following:
recheck  - Run the standard test suite again.
recheck designate  - Run the tests for the openstack_dns_*  resources.
recheck trove  - Run the tests for the openstack_db_*  resources.

openstack_blockstorage_volume_attach_v2
This resource is experimental and may be removed in  the future! Feedback is requested if you find this  resource
useful or if you find any problems with it.
Creates a general purpose attachment connection to a Block Storage volume using the OpenStack Block St orage
(Cinder) v2 API. Depending on your Block Storage se rvice configuration, this resource can assist in at taching a
volume to a non-OpenStack resource such as a bare-m etal server or a remote virtual machine in a differ ent cloud
provider.
This does not actually attach a volume to an instan ce. Please use the openstack_compute_volume_attach_v2
resource for that.
Example Usage
resource "openstack_blockstorage_volume_v2" "volume _1" {
  name = "volume_1"
  size = 1
}
resource "openstack_blockstorage_volume_attach_v2" "va_1" {
  volume_id  = "${openstack_blockstorage_volume_v2.volume_1.id}"
  device     = "auto"
  host_name  = "devstack"
  ip_address = "192.168.255.10"
  initiator  = "iqn.1993-08.org.debian:01:e9861fb1859"
  os_type    = "linux2"
  platform   = "x86_64"
}
Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
region  - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Block Storage client. A Block Storage client is
needed to create a volume attachment. If omitted, t he region  argument of the provider is used. Changing this
creates a new volume attachment.
attach_mode  - (Optional) Specify whether to attach the volume as Read-Only ( ro) or Read-Write ( rw). Only
values of ro and rw are accepted. If left unspecified, the Block Stora ge API will apply a default of rw.device  - (Optional) The device to tell the Block Storage service this volume will be attached as. This is pu rely
for informational purposes. You can specify auto  or a device such as /dev/vdc .
host_name  - (Required) The host to attach the volume to.
initiator  - (Optional) The iSCSI initiator string to make th e connection.
ip_address  - (Optional) The IP address of the host_name  above.
multipath  - (Optional) Whether to connect to this volume via  multipath.
os_type  - (Optional) The iSCSI initiator OS type.
platform  - (Optional) The iSCSI initiator platform.
volume_id  - (Required) The ID of the Volume to attach to an Instance.
wwpn  - (Optional) An array of wwpn strings. Used for Fi bre Channel connections.
wwnn  - (Optional) A wwnn name. Used for Fibre Channel c onnections.
Attributes Reference
In addition to the above, the following attributes are exported:
data  - This is a map of key/value pairs that contain th e connection information. You will want to pass thi s
information to a provisioner script to finalize the  connection. See below for more information.
driver_volume_type  - The storage driver that the volume is based on.
mount_point_base  - A mount point base name for shared storage.
Volume Connection Data
Upon creation of this resource, a data  exported attribute will be available. This attribu te is a set of key/value pairs
that contains the information required to complete the block storage connection.
As an example, creating an iSCSI-based volume will return the following:
data.access_mode = rw
data.auth_method = CHAP
data.auth_password = xUhbGKQ8QCwKmHQ2
data.auth_username = Sphn5X4EoyFUUMYVYSA4
data.target_iqn = iqn.2010-10.org.openstack:volume- 2d87ed25-c312-4f42-be1d-3b36b014561d
data.target_portal = 192.168.255.10:3260
data.volume_id = 2d87ed25-c312-4f42-be1d-3b36b01456 1d
This information can then be fed into a provisioner  or a template shell script, where the final result  would look
something like:iscsiadm -m node -T ${self.data.target_iqn} -p ${se lf.data.target_portal} --interface default --op ne

-v automatic
iscsiadm -m node -T ${self.data.target_iqn} -p ${se lf.data.target_portal} --rescan
The contents of data  will vary from each Block Storage service. You mus t have a good understanding of how the
service is configured and how to make the appropria te final connection. However, if used correctly, th is has the
flexibility to be able to attach OpenStack Block St orage volumes to non-OpenStack resources.

Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
region  - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Compute client. Keypairs are associated with
accounts, but a Compute client is needed to create one. If omitted, the region  argument of the provider is
used. Changing this creates a new floatingip_associ ate.
floating_ip  - (Required) The floating IP to associate.
instance_id  - (Required) The instance to associte the floating  IP with.
fixed_ip  - (Optional) The specific IP address to direct tra ffic to.
wait_until_associated  - (Optional) In cases where the OpenStack environm ent does not automatically wait
until the association has finished, set this option  to have Terraform poll the instance until the floa ting IP has
been associated. Defaults to false.

openstack_compute_ﬂoatingip_v2
Manages a V2 floating IP resource within OpenStack Nova (compute) that can be used for compute instanc es.
Please note that managing floating IPs through the OpenStack Compute API has been deprecated. Unless y ou are
using an older OpenStack environment, it is recomme nded to use the openstack_networking_floatingip_v2
(/docs/providers/openstack/r/networking_floatingip_ v2.html) resource instead, which uses the OpenStack
Networking API.
Example Usage
resource "openstack_compute_floatingip_v2" "floatip _1" {
  pool = "public"
}
Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
region  - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Compute client. A Compute client is needed to
create a floating IP that can be used with a comput e instance. If omitted, the region  argument of the provider
is used. Changing this creates a new floating IP (w hich may or may not have a different address).
pool  - (Required) The name of the pool from which to ob tain the floating IP. Changing this creates a new
floating IP.
Attributes Reference
The following attributes are exported:
region  - See Argument Reference above.
pool  - See Argument Reference above.
address  - The actual floating IP address itself.
fixed_ip  - The fixed IP address corresponding to the floati ng IP.
instance_id  - UUID of the compute instance associated with the  floating IP.Import
Floating IPs can be imported using the id, e.g.

Multiple Ephemeral Disks
It's possible to specify multiple block_device  entries to create an instance with multiple epheme ral (local) disks. In
order to create multiple ephemeral disks, the sum o f the total amount of ephemeral space must be less than or
equal to what the chosen flavor supports.
The following example shows how to create an instan ce with multiple ephemeral disks:
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "foo" {
  name            = "terraform-test"
  security_groups = ["default"]
  block_device {
    boot_index            = 0
    delete_on_termination = true
    destination_type      = "local"
    source_type           = "image"
    uuid                  = "<image uuid>"
  }
  block_device {
    boot_index            = -1
    delete_on_termination = true
    destination_type      = "local"
    source_type           = "blank"
    volume_size           = 1
  }
  block_device {
    boot_index            = -1
    delete_on_termination = true
    destination_type      = "local"
    source_type           = "blank"
    volume_size           = 1
  }
}
Instances and Security Groups
When referencing a security group resource in an in stance resource, always use the name  of the security group. If
you specify the ID of the security group, Terraform  will remove and reapply the security group upon ea ch call. This
is because the OpenStack Compute API returns the na mes of the associated security groups and not their  IDs.
Note the following example:resource "openstack_networking_secgroup_v2" "sg_1" {
  name = "sg_1"
}
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "foo" {
  name            = "terraform-test"
  security_groups = ["${openstack_networking_secgroup_v2.sg_1.name}"]
}
Instances and Ports
Neutron Ports are a great feature and provide a lot  of functionality. However, there are some notes to  be aware of
when mixing Instances and Ports:
In OpenStack environments prior to the Kilo release , deleting or recreating an Instance will cause the
Instance's Port(s) to be deleted. One way of workin g around this is to taint any Port(s) used in Insta nces which
are to be recreated. See here (https://review.opens tack.org/#/c/126309/) for further information.
When attaching an Instance to one or more networks using Ports, place the security groups on the Port and
not the Instance. If you place the security groups on the Instance, the security groups will not be ap plied upon
creation, but they will be applied upon a refresh. This is a known OpenStack bug.
Network IP information is not available within an i nstance for networks that are attached with Ports. This is
mostly due to the flexibility Neutron Ports provide  when it comes to IP addresses. For example, a Neut ron Port
can have multiple Fixed IP addresses associated wit h it. It's not possible to know which single IP add ress the
user would want returned to the Instance's state in formation. Therefore, in order for a Provisioner to  connect to
an Instance via it's network Port, customize the connection  information:resource "openstack_networking_port_v2" "port_1" {
  name           = "port_1"
  admin_state_up = "true"
  network_id = "0a1d0a27-cffa-4de3-92c5-9d3fd3f2e74d"
  security_group_ids = [
    "2f02d20a-8dca-49b7-b26f-b6ce9fddaf4f",
    "ca1e5ed7-dae8-4605-987b-fadaeeb30461",
  ]
}
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "instance_ 1" {
  name = "instance_1"
  network {
    port = "${openstack_networking_port_v2.port_1.id}"
  }
  connection {
    user        = "root"
    host        = "${openstack_networking_port_v2.port_1.fixed_ip.0. ip_address}"
    private_key = "~/path/to/key"
  }
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "echo terraform executed > /tmp/foo",
    ]
  }
}
Instances and Networks
Instances almost always require a network. Here are  some notes to be aware of with how Instances and N etworks
relate:
In scenarios where you only have one network availa ble, you can create an instance without specifying a
network  block. OpenStack will automatically launch the ins tance on this network.
If you have access to more than one network, you wi ll need to specify a network with a network  block. Not
specifying a network will result in the following e rror:
* openstack_compute_instance_v2.instance: Error cre ating OpenStack server:
Expected HTTP response code [201 202] when accessin g [POST https://example.com:8774/v2.1/servers], but
 got 409 instead
{"conflictingRequest": {"message": "Multiple possib le networks found, use a Network ID to be more spec
ific.", "code": 409}}
If you intend to use the openstack_compute_interface_attach_v2  resource, you still need to make sure one of
the above points is satisfied. An instance cannot b e created without a valid network configuration eve n if youintend to use openstack_compute_interface_attach_v2  after the instance has been created.

Importing instances can be tricky, since the nova a pi does not offer all information provided at creat ion time for later
retrieval. Network interface attachment order, and number and sizes of ephemeral disks are examples of  this.
Importing basic instance
Assume you want to import an instance with one ephe meral root disk, and one network interface.
Your configuration would look like the following:
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "basic_ins tance" {
  name            = "basic"
  flavor_id       = "<flavor_id>"
  key_pair        = "<keyname>"
  security_groups = ["default"]
  image_id =  "<image_id>"
  network {
    name = "<network_name>"
  }
}
Then you execute terraform import openstack_compute_instance_v2.basi c_instance <instance_id>
Importing an instance with multiple emphemeral disk s
The importer cannot read the emphemeral disk config uration of an instance, so just specify image_id as  in the
configuration of the basic instance example.
Importing instance with multiple network interfaces .
Nova returns the network interfaces grouped by netw ork, thus not in creation order. That means that if  you have
multiple network interfaces you must take care of t he order of networks in your configuration.
As example we want to import an instance with one e phemeral root disk, and 3 network interfaces.
Examplesresource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "boot-from -volume" {
  name            = "boot-from-volume"
  flavor_id       = "<flavor_id"
  key_pair        = "<keyname>"
  image_id        = <image_id >
  security_groups = ["default"]
  network {
    name = "<network1>"
  }
  network {
    name = "<network2>"
  }
  network {
    name = "<network1>"
    fixed_ip_v4 = "<fixed_ip_v4>"
  }
}
In the above configuration the networks are out of order compared to what nova and thus the import cod e returns,
which means the plan will not be empty after import .
So either with care check the plan and modify confi guration, or read the network order in the state fi le after import
and modify your configuration accordingly.
A note on ports. If you have created a neutron port  independent of an instance, then the import code h as no
way to detect that the port is created idenpendentl y, and therefore on deletion of imported instances you
might have port resources in your project, which yo u expected to be created by the instance and thus t o also
be deleted with the instance.
Importing instances with multiple block storage vol umes.
We have an instance with two block storage volumes,  one bootable and one non-bootable. Note that we on ly
configure the bootable device as block_device. The other volumes can be specified as
openstack_blockstorage_volume_v2resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "instance_ 2" {
  name            = "instance_2"
  image_id        = "<image_id>"
  flavor_id       = "<flavor_id>"
  key_pair        = "<keyname>"
  security_groups = ["default"]
  block_device {
    uuid = <image_id >"
    source_type = "image"
    destination_type = "volume"
    boot_index = 0
    delete_on_termination = true
  }
   network {
    name = " <network_name >"
  }
}
resource "openstack_blockstorage_volume_v2" "volume _1" {
  size        = 1
  name =     " <vol_name >"
}
resource "openstack_compute_volume_attach_v2" "va_1 " {
  volume_id = "${openstack_blockstorage_volume_v2. volume_1 .id}"
  instance_id = "${openstack_compute_instance_v2. instance_2 .id}"
}
To import the instance outlined in the above config uration do the following:
terraform import openstack_compute_instance_v2.inst ance_2 <instance_id>
import openstack_blockstorage_volume_v2.volume_1 <v olume_id>
terraform import openstack_compute_volume_attach_v2 .va_1
<instance_id>/<volume_id>
A note on block storage volumes, the importer does not read delete_on_termination flag, and always
assumes true. If you import an instance created wit h delete_on_termination false, you end up with "orp haned"
volumes after destruction of instances.Write an infrastructure application in TypeScript a nd Python using CDK for TerraformLIVE

openstack_compute_secgroup_v2
Manages a V2 security group resource within OpenSta ck.
Please note that managing security groups through t he OpenStack Compute API has been deprecated. Unles s you
are using an older OpenStack environment, it is rec ommended to use the openstack_networking_secgroup_v2
(/docs/providers/openstack/r/networking_secgroup_v2 .html) and openstack_networking_secgroup_rule_v2
(/docs/providers/openstack/r/networking_secgroup_ru le_v2.html) resources instead, which uses the OpenS tack
Networking API.
Example Usage
resource "openstack_compute_secgroup_v2" "secgroup_ 1" {
  name        = "my_secgroup"
  description = "my security group"
  rule {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    ip_protocol = "tcp"
    cidr        = "0.0.0.0/0"
  }
  rule {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    ip_protocol = "tcp"
    cidr        = "0.0.0.0/0"
  }
}
Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
region  - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Compute client. A Compute client is needed to
create a security group. If omitted, the region  argument of the provider is used. Changing this cr eates a new
security group.
name  - (Required) A unique name for the security group.  Changing this updates the name  of an existing
security group.
description  - (Required) A description for the security group.  Changing this updates the description  of anexisting security group.
rule  - (Optional) A rule describing how the security gr oup operates. The rule object structure is document ed
below. Changing this updates the security group rul es. As shown in the example above, multiple rule bl ocks
may be used.
The rule  block supports:
from_port  - (Required) An integer representing the lower bou nd of the port range to open. Changing this
creates a new security group rule.
to_port  - (Required) An integer representing the upper bou nd of the port range to open. Changing this
creates a new security group rule.
ip_protocol  - (Required) The protocol type that will be allowe d. Changing this creates a new security group
rule.
cidr  - (Optional) Required if from_group_id  or self  is empty. The IP range that will be the source of
network traffic to the security group. Use 0.0.0.0/ 0 to allow all IP addresses. Changing this creates a new
security group rule. Cannot be combined with from_group_id  or self .
from_group_id  - (Optional) Required if cidr  or self  is empty. The ID of a group from which to forward
traffic to the parent group. Changing this creates a new security group rule. Cannot be combined with cidr  or
self .
self  - (Optional) Required if cidr  and from_group_id  is empty. If true, the security group itself will be
added as a source to this ingress rule. Cannot be c ombined with cidr  or from_group_id .
Attributes Reference
The following attributes are exported:
region  - See Argument Reference above.
name  - See Argument Reference above.
description  - See Argument Reference above.
rule  - See Argument Reference above.
Notes
ICMP Rules
When using ICMP as the ip_protocol , the from_port  sets the ICMP type and the to_port  sets the ICMP code . To
allow all ICMP types, set each value to -1, like so:rule {
  from_port   = -1
  to_port     = -1
  ip_protocol = "icmp"
  cidr        = "0.0.0.0/0"
}
A list of ICMP types and codes can be found here
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Mes sage_Protocol#Control_messages).
Referencing Security Groups
When referencing a security group in a configuratio n (for example, a configuration creates a new secur ity group and
then needs to apply it to an instance being created  in the same configuration), it is currently recomm ended to
reference the security group by name and not by ID,  like this:
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "test-serv er" {
  name            = "tf-test"
  image_id        = "ad091b52-742f-469e-8f3c-fd81cadf0743"
  flavor_id       = "3"
  key_pair        = "my_key_pair_name"
  security_groups = ["${openstack_compute_secgroup_v2.secgroup_1.name} "]
}
Import
Security Groups can be imported using the id, e.g.

}Using Multiattach-enabled volumes
Multiattach Volumes are dependent upon your OpenSta ck cloud and not all clouds support multiattach.
resource "openstack_blockstorage_volume_v3" "volume _1" {
  name        = "volume_1"
  size        = 1
  multiattach = true
}
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "instance_ 1" {
  name            = "instance_1"
  security_groups = ["default"]
}
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "instance_ 2" {
  name            = "instance_2"
  security_groups = ["default"]
}
resource "openstack_compute_volume_attach_v2" "va_1 " {
  instance_id = "${openstack_compute_instance_v2.instance_1.id}"
  volume_id   = "${openstack_blockstorage_volume_v2.volume_1.id}"
  multiattach = true
}
resource "openstack_compute_volume_attach_v2" "va_2 " {
  instance_id = "${openstack_compute_instance_v2.instance_2.id}"
  volume_id   = "${openstack_blockstorage_volume_v2.volume_1.id}"
  multiattach = true
  depends_on = ["openstack_compute_volume_attach_v2.va_1"]
}
It is recommended to use depends_on  for the attach resources to enforce the volume att achments to happen one
at a time.
Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
region  - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Compute client. A Compute client is needed to
create a volume attachment. If omitted, the region  argument of the provider is used. Changing this cr eates a
new volume attachment.
instance_id  - (Required) The ID of the Instance to attach the Volume to.
volume_id  - (Required) The ID of the Volume to attach to an Instance.
device  - (Optional) The device of the volume attachment ( ex: /dev/vdc ). NOTE : Being able to specify a
device is dependent upon the hypervisor in use. The re is a chance that the device specified in Terrafo rm will
not be the same device the hypervisor chose. If thi s happens, Terraform will wish to update the device  uponsubsequent applying which will cause the volume to be detached and reattached indefinitely. Please use  with
caution.
multiattach  - (Optional) Enable attachment of multiattach-capa ble volumes.

The following attributes are exported:
region  - See Argument Reference above.
instance_id  - See Argument Reference above.

openstack_networking_port_secgroup_associate_v2
Manages a V2 port's security groups within OpenStac k. Useful, when the port was created not by Terrafo rm (e.g.
Manila or LBaaS). It should not be used, when the p ort was created directly within Terraform.
When the resource is deleted, Terraform doesn't del ete the port, but unsets the list of user defined s ecurity group
IDs. However, if enforce  is set to true  and the resource is deleted, Terraform will remove  all assigned security
group IDs.
Example Usage
Append a security group to an existing port
data "openstack_networking_port_v2" "system_port" {
  fixed_ip = "10.0.0.10"
}
data "openstack_networking_secgroup_v2" "secgroup" {

github_actions_secret
This resource allows you to create and manage GitHu b Actions secrets within your GitHub repositories. You must
have write access to a repository to use this resou rce.
Secret values are encrypted using the Go '/crypto/b ox' module
(https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box) wh ich is interoperable with libsodium
(https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/). Libsodium is u sed by Github to decrypt secret values.
For the purposes of security, the contents of the plaintext_value  field have been marked as sensitive  to
Terraform, but it is important to note that this does not hide it from state files . You should treat state as sensitive
always. It is also advised that you do not store pl aintext values in your code but rather populate the
plaintext_value  using fields from a resource, data source or varia ble as, while encrypted in state, these will be
easily accessible in your code. See below for an ex ample of this abstraction.
Example Usage
data "github_actions_public_key" "example_public_ke y" {
  repository = "example_repository"
