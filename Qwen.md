Hi, Would like to ask if any one knows whether PO Invoices may be modified after they have been created. Similar to FI documents which can be modified via transaction FB02. I'm unable to find a counterpart transaction in the MM module for the Logistic Invoices. Does that mean that if changes need to be made to the logistic invoice, it needs to be reversed and a new invoice needs to be created
